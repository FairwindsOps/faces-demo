# TIMEOUTS
#
# Things are better, but still too slow. Let's add
# timeouts, starting from the bottom of the call graph
# this time.
#
# You'll see pink backgrounds here: timeouts aren't about
# protecting the service, they're about providing agency
# to the client. Here, the face service chooses to show
# timeouts as a pink background.

# TIMEOUTS
#
# Finally, we'll add a timeout when Emissary calls the
# faces service.
#
# Here, the client is the web app. The web app is OK
# showing the user older data rather than showing them a
# failure, but for the moment it will also put a counter
# in the corner so that we can see when it's doing so for
# demo purposes.

# RATELIMITS
#
# Suppose someone adds some code to the faces service
# that makes it collapse under too much load, rather than
# just getting slower?
#
# As it happens, our faces service has exactly that code,
# which we'll enable now.

# RATELIMITS
#
# We can tell Emissary to enforce a rate limit for
# requests to the faces service. This is both protecting
# the service and providing agency to the client: here,
# our web app is going to handle rate limits just like it
# handles timeouts.

# SUMMARY
#
# We've used both Emissary and Linkerd to take a very,
# very broken application and turn it into something the
# user might actually have an OK experience with. Fixing
# the application is, of course, still necessary!! but
# making the user experience better is a good thing.
